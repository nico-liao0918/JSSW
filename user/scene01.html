                    <p>The Foundational Scene.</p>
                    <p>This scenario is not part of any book or scenario I am writing about. This is a separate writing story or scenario.</p>
                    <p>The current year of this is 2025.</p>
                    <p>I am the author of this and yet I am also the character in this scenario.</p>
                    <p>I was given a Wishing Stone in 2017. Since then I have not used it until 2022.</p>
                    <p>My wishes will be given in depth in the Backstory Scene later on. But my wishes are Money, Pre Fabricated Inventions, Protection, Success, and Pheromones.</p>
                    <p>When the Wishing Stone was given to me. I was still in the hospital with my Father in the hospital bed. A man came to me and said that you need this more than I do. And I was in the Restroom at the time washing my hands. I accepted the package without asking what it is for. When I was done. I turned and he was no longer there. I rushed out but there was no one there. And plus. It was night. Like around 12 midnight. There was little staff but when I asked no one knew about where he went or who he was. So. I kept it in my bag for safekeeping.</p>
                    <p>Thus. The end of the Foundational Scene.</p>
